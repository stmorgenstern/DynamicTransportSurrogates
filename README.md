# DynamicTransportSurrogates
This repository is the code for my final project for CSE 5835. In this work, I implemented two approaches for constructing a surrogate model for a mechanistic model of fluid and solute transport in tumors. The overall goal was to develop the most accurate mapping between biological parameters of interest and an accumulation profile over a fixed time horizon. The first surrogate modeling approach was to learn a model for multidimensional regression between the parameters and the full accumulation profile. The second approach was to learn a mapping between the parameters, the current time step, the current concentration value and the concentration at the next time step.
